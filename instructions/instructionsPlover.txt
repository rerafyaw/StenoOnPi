# Compilation by Anderson Ang (@rerafyaw, on Github), 2017
# May release a bash script for entirely new users to ARM-based Linux (debian),
# and want to get Plover running ASAP.

List of required prerequisite packages:
1) Python 2.7.X and above (with pip support)
2) wxPython, a GUI API alternative to Tkinter
3) wmctrl
4) Cython-based HIDAPI
5) libusb and libudev (together with python 2.7)
6) setuptools (copackaged with pip)

Actual package:
1) plover-3.1.0.whl (whl file)

- First, make sure wmctrl is installed by executing:
	1) sudo apt-get install wmctrl
- If Python 2.X is NOT installed, execute the following:
	1) sudo apt-get install python-dev
- To get wxPython, run the following:
	1) sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxtools wx2.8-i18n
	   libwxgtk2.8-dev

- IMPORTANT: setuptools is a key dependency on Python, which is required 
for Plover, especially with respect to installation of packages using Python

To properly install it (the latest version is required):
	1) sudo pip install -U pip setuptools

If pip is ALREADY installed, or an older version of setuptools:
	1) sudo apt-get install --upgrade setuptools

- lastly, Plover depends on a core dependency known as the HIDAPI library,
which allows for communication with the USB and Bluetooth HID devices on OSes.

- To install it, the following must be executed:
	1) sudo apt-get install python-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
	2) sudo pip install hidapi (at this point, wxPython MUST be installed)

When all of the prerequisites are successfully installed, download the LATEST
Plover version from the website (you can google this), then execute:
	1) python2 -m pip install --user plover-3.1.0-py2-none-any.whl

* The Plover version number used here (3.1.0) may change as the stable-version
updates.
